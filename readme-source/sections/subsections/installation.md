Easiest setup: For one-time menu-driven package-level installation, run the following command:

```
npx nanocommit --init
```

The above command will set up the configuration you need in your package to use nanocommit, and will install the package locally for you. The menu system should be straightforward.  If you have any feedback, please submit it to the nanocommit github issues board.


You can either install nanocommit globally:

```
npm install nanocommit -g
```

Or you can install it locally to a package:

```
npm install nanocommit --save-dev
```
