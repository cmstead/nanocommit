**Note**

If you ran `npx nanocommit --init` and chose to install nanocommit locally, you don't need to do any other configuration.

**Everyone else:**

If you installed nanocommit globally, run the following command and follow the prompts:

```
nanocommit --init
```

**Configuration By Hand**

This is not recommended. Please use --init unless you really, really know what you intend to do.
