Nanocommit (properly, "nanocommit") is a tool which will commit your code for you when your tests pass.  This means you can work all day and, each time you run your commits, your work will be saved! (That's all it does.)

Currently, nanocommit is aimed at Node and Javascript packages which contain a package.json file.  If there is enough demand, I will extend functionality.
